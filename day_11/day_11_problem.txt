--- Day 11: Cosmic Expansion ---

You continue following signs for "Hot Springs" and eventually come across an 
observatory. The Elf within turns out to be a researcher studying cosmic 
expansion using the giant telescope here.

He doesn't know anything about the missing machine parts; he's only visiting 
for this research project. However, he confirms that the hot springs are the 
next-closest area likely to have people; he'll even take you straight there 
once he's done with today's observation analysis.

Maybe you can help him with the analysis to speed things up?

The researcher has collected a bunch of data and compiled the data into a single
giant image (your puzzle input). The image includes empty space (.) and galaxies
(#). For example:

...#......
.......#..
#.........
..........
......#...
.#........
.........#
..........
.......#..
#...#.....

The researcher is trying to figure out the sum of the lengths of the shortest 
path between every pair of galaxies. However, there's a catch: the universe 
expanded in the time it took the light from those galaxies to reach the 
observatory.

Due to something involving gravitational effects, only some space expands. In 
fact, the result is that any rows or columns that contain no galaxies should all
actually be twice as big.

In the above example, three columns and two rows contain no galaxies:

   v  v  v
 ...#......
 .......#..
 #.........
>..........<
 ......#...
 .#........
 .........#
>..........<
 .......#..
 #...#.....
   ^  ^  ^

These rows and columns need to be twice as big; the result of cosmic expansion 
therefore looks like this:

....#........
.........#...
#............
.............
.............
........#....
.#...........
............#
.............
.............
.........#...
#....#.......

Equipped with this expanded universe, the shortest path between every pair of 
galaxies can be found. It can help to assign every galaxy a unique number:

....1........
.........2...
3............
.............
.............
........4....
.5...........
............6
.............
.............
.........7...
8....9.......

In these 9 galaxies, there are 36 pairs. Only count each pair once; order within
the pair doesn't matter. For each pair, find any shortest path between the two 
galaxies using only steps that move up, down, left, or right exactly one . or # 
at a time. (The shortest path between two galaxies is allowed to pass through 
another galaxy.)

For example, here is one of the shortest paths between galaxies 5 and 9:

....1........
.........2...
3............
.............
.............
........4....
.5...........
.##.........6
..##.........
...##........
....##...7...
8....9.......

This path has length 9 because it takes a minimum of nine steps to get from 
galaxy 5 to galaxy 9 (the eight locations marked # plus the step onto galaxy 9 
itself). Here are some other example shortest path lengths:

    Between galaxy 1 and galaxy 7: 15
    Between galaxy 3 and galaxy 6: 17
    Between galaxy 8 and galaxy 9: 5

In this example, after expanding the universe, the sum of the shortest path 
between all 36 pairs of galaxies is 374.

Expand the universe, then find the length of the shortest path between every 
pair of galaxies. What is the sum of these lengths?

Initial Thoughts:
So here is my initial plan
1. Put data into numpy array
2. Scan data row by row and mark down rows with no galaxy
3. Insert extra row next to empty row.
4. Scan data column by column and mark down columns with no galaxy
5. Insert extra column next to empty columns.
6. Find all galaxies coordinates.
7. Since we want the distance between all pairs a nested for loop should work.
    EG
    For i in range (0, len(list_of_galaxies)):
      for j in range(i+1, len(list_of_galaxies)):
        dist = abs(galaxy[i] - galaxy[j])
    Distance will be abs(galaxy_1_row-galaxy_2_row)+abs(galaxy_1_col-galaxy_2_col)

--- Part Two ---

The galaxies are much older (and thus much farther apart) than the researcher 
initially estimated.

Now, instead of the expansion you did before, make each empty row or column one 
million times larger. That is, each empty row should be replaced with 1000000 
empty rows, and each empty column should be replaced with 1000000 empty columns.

(In the example above, if each empty row or column were merely 10 times larger, 
the sum of the shortest paths between every pair of galaxies would be 1030. If 
each empty row or column were merely 100 times larger, the sum of the shortest 
paths between every pair of galaxies would be 8410. However, your universe 
will need to expand far beyond these values.)

Starting with the same initial image, expand the universe according to these new
rules, then find the length of the shortest path between every pair of galaxies.
What is the sum of these lengths?

Initial Thoughts:
Instead of actually making a "model", we should find empty rows, cols
Then calculate distance between galaxies. As we calculate the distance
between rows/cols we check how many extra rows/cols there are and 
add 1,000,000.
